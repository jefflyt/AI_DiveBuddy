# Step 1.4: Create Environment Template (.env.example)

**Part of:** PR 1.1 - Next.js Project Setup & UI Framework
**Focus:** Add a minimal `.env.example` documenting environment variables used during development and CI.

## Goal

Provide a safe template for environment variables (no secrets) and document required variables for local development.

## Implementation

Create a `.env.example` at the repo root with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase (replace with your own keys in local .env)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# OpenAI / Google AI / LLM provider
NEXT_PUBLIC_LLM_PROVIDER=google
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=

# Optional analytics or monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `.env.example` exists at repo root
- [ ] No secret keys checked into repository
- [ ] README includes a short note pointing to `.env.example`

## What Comes Next

- Wire Supabase and provider keys during integration steps (2.x).

**Note:** This file is a short template-only reference containing the `.env` keys. For a more detailed, step-by-step environment setup (including README instructions and verification), see `1.4-environment-setup.md` in the same folder.
