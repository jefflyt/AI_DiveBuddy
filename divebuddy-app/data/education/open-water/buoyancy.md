# Buoyancy Control

Buoyancy control is the ability to maintain neutral buoyancy underwater, which helps conserve energy and protect marine life.

Key points:

- Use your breath: inhale to rise slightly, exhale to descend slightly.
- Trim: position your weight and gear so you float horizontally.
- BCD adjustments: make small, incremental changes.
- Practice hovering in shallow water before attempting deeper dives.

## Buoyancy Importance

Buoyancy control is the ability to maintain desired depth and trim while conserving air and energy. Mastering buoyancy is one of the most important skills for safe diving.

## Principles

- Neutral buoyancy: neither sinking nor rising.
- Positive buoyancy: rising to the surface.
- Negative buoyancy: sinking toward the bottom.

## Techniques

Use breath control, trim adjustments, and proper weighting. Practice in shallow water before applying skills in deeper environments.
