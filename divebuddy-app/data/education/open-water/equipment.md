- Buoyancy Control Device (BCD): allows control of buoyancy at surface and depth.
- Regulator: delivers breathing gas from the tank.
- Cylinder (tank): stores breathing gas.
- Exposure protection: wetsuit or drysuit according to water temperature.

Always check and maintain your gear, and practice assembling and disassembling it before dives.
